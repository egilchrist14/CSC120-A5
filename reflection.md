Associates: Lizzie DelMonico

I like association it's interesting to work with and I think it gave me a better idea of how object-oriented programming works. What worked was paying close attention to the read me and using the right syntax since I'm still getting used to Java. Pretty much my biggest problem was figuring out how to translate Python to Java since that's the language I'm still thinking in.
